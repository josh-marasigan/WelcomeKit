## Inspiration
WelcomeKit aims to be an easy to use iOS Library for creating beautiful user onboarding experiences with Lottie and Adobe After Effects.

Every time I see animated welcome/onboarding screens that match a user's drag or interaction speed, I always go "how in the world do they do that?". Manually animating drawn or geometric shapes/components seemed like a really daunting task, but with AirBnb's <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios" style="text-decoration: none"><b>Lottie</b></a> Animation Library, and Adobe After Effects, we're able to make these same user experiences without the technical overhead by delegating animation efforts to the designer.
